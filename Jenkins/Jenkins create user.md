The Nautilus team is planning to use Jenkins for some of their CI/CD pipelines. DevOps team has just installed a fresh Jenkins server and they are configuring it further to be available for use.

Click on the Jenkins button on the top bar to access the Jenkins UI. Login using username admin and password Adm!n321.

It has only a sample job for now. A new developer has joined the Nautilus application development team and they want this user to be added to the Jenkins server as per the details mentioned below:



1. Create a jenkins user named javed with ksH85UJjhb password, their full name should be Javed (it is case sensitive).

2. Using Project-based Matrix Authorization Strategy assign overall read permission to javed user.

3. Remember to remove all permissions for Anonymous users (if given) and make sure admin user has overall Administer permissions.

4. There is one existing job, make sure javed only has read permissions to that job (we are not worried about other permissions like Agent, SCM, etc.).

cant find the Project-based Matrix Authorization Strategy
ChatGPT
I apologize for the confusion. If you cannot find the "Project-based Matrix Authorization Strategy," it's possible that your Jenkins instance might have a different version or a different security plugin enabled. In that case, you might need to adjust the steps accordingly.

Here's an alternative approach using the "Matrix Authorization Strategy" which is commonly available in Jenkins:

Create the User:
Follow the same steps as mentioned earlier to create the user javed with the password ksH85UJjhb and full name Javed.

Configure User Permissions:

From the left sidebar, click on "Manage Jenkins."
Select "Configure Global Security."
Under the "Authorization" section, choose "Matrix-based security."
Find the user javed in the "Users" section.
Check the "Overall Read" permission for the user javed.
Scroll down and click the "Save" button.
Adjust Permissions for Anonymous Users:

While still on the "Configure Global Security" page, find the "Anonymous" row.
Remove all permissions for the "Anonymous" user by unchecking all checkboxes.
Click the "Save" button.
Adjust Admin User Permissions:

Make sure the "admin" user still has the "Overall" permission set to "Administer."
Limit Job Permissions:

Go back to the Jenkins dashboard by clicking the "Jenkins" logo at the top left corner.
Find and click on the existing job.
In the left sidebar, click on "Configure."
Scroll down to the "Build Triggers" section.
Click the "Enable project-based security" checkbox.
Add javed to the "Add user" field.
Select the "Read" permission for the user javed.
Click the "Save" button.
Please note that Jenkins might have variations in its interface based on the version and installed plugins. If you still face difficulties, refer to your Jenkins documentation or seek assistance from your Jenkins administrator or support.

I apologize for any confusion. It seems that the Jenkins interface and options might vary based on the version and configuration. If you cannot find the specific options mentioned, you can achieve similar results using an alternative approach. Here's a more generic way to grant permissions to the javed user for the job:

Create the User:
Follow the steps mentioned earlier to create the user javed with the password ksH85UJjhb and full name Javed.

Configure User Permissions:

From the left sidebar, click on "Manage Jenkins."
Select "Manage and Assign Roles."
Click on "Manage Roles."
Click on "Create new Role."
Name the role as "Read Access Role."
In the "Pattern" field, you can use * to indicate all jobs.
In the "Permissions" section, add the "Read" permission.
Save the role.
Assign Role to User:

Click on "Assign Roles."
Find the user javed.
Assign the "Read Access Role" to the user.
Save the configuration.
Job-Level Permissions:

Go back to the Jenkins dashboard by clicking the "Jenkins" logo at the top left corner.
Find and click on the existing job.
In the left sidebar, click on "Configure."
Scroll down to the "Enable project-based security" section if available.
If not available, go to the "Permission" section.
Add javed to the "Users and roles" field.
Select the "Read Access Role" for the user.
Save the configuration.
Please note that Jenkins' interface might have changed over time, and these instructions aim to provide a general guideline. If you are unable to find the exact options mentioned, look for similar options that allow you to manage permissions for users and jobs within your Jenkins instance. If you're unsure, reaching out to your Jenkins administrator or referring to the Jenkins documentation can be helpful.

how to restart jenkins on cli
ChatGPT
To restart Jenkins from the command line, you can use the following methods based on your system and setup:

Using System Service Manager:

If Jenkins is installed as a system service, you can use the system's service manager to restart it. The command might differ depending on your operating system. Here are some examples:

On Linux (systemd):

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl restart jenkins
On macOS (launchctl):

bash
Copy code
sudo launchctl stop org.jenkins-ci
sudo launchctl start org.jenkins-ci
On Windows (sc command):

batch
Copy code
sc stop "Jenkins"
sc start "Jenkins"
Using Jenkins CLI:

If you have the Jenkins CLI (Command Line Interface) installed, you can also use it to trigger a restart. Here's how:

First, make sure you have the Jenkins CLI installed. You can download it from your Jenkins server by visiting http://your-jenkins-server/jnlpJars/jenkins-cli.jar.

Open a terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the jenkins-cli.jar file.

Run the following command to restart Jenkins:

bash
Copy code
java -jar jenkins-cli.jar -s http://your-jenkins-server/ restart
Replace http://your-jenkins-server/ with the actual URL of your Jenkins server.

Directly Restarting Jenkins:

If none of the above methods work or if you don't have the Jenkins CLI installed, you can manually restart Jenkins by stopping and starting the Jenkins process:

Open a terminal or command prompt.

Depending on how Jenkins was started, you might need to navigate to the directory where Jenkins is installed or where the jenkins.war file is located.

Stop Jenkins:

bash
Copy code
java -jar jenkins.war stop
Start Jenkins again:

bash
Copy code
java -jar jenkins.war start
Please choose the method that is suitable for your environment and setup. Make sure to follow the appropriate steps based on your operating system and Jenkins installation method.
