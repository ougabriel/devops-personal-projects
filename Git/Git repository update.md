The Nautilus development team started with new project development. They have created different Git repositories to manage respective project's source code. One of the repositories /opt/beta.git was created recently. The team has given us a sample index.html file that is currently present on jump host under /tmp directory. The repository has been cloned at /usr/src/kodekloudrepos on storage server in Stratos DC.



Copy sample index.html file from jump host to storage server under cloned repository at /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/beta, further add/commit the file and push to the master branch.


----------

To achieve the task of copying the sample `index.html` file to the cloned repository directory, committing the changes, and pushing to the master branch, follow these steps:

1. **Copy `index.html` to Cloned Repository Directory:**

   Copy the `index.html` file from the jump host to the cloned repository directory on the storage server.

   ```bash
   scp /tmp/index.html natasha@ststor01:/usr/src/kodekloudrepos/beta/
   ```

if you have issues with file permissions, ssh into the storage-server and   

```bash
   sudo chmod o+rwx usr/src/kodekloudrepos/beta/
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Cloned Repository Directory:**

   SSH into the storage server and navigate to the cloned repository directory.

   ```bash
   ssh storage-server
   cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/beta
   ```

3. **Add and Commit the File:**

   Use the following commands to add and commit the `index.html` file:

   ```bash
   git add index.html
   git commit -m "Add index.html"
   ```

   Replace `"Add index.html"` with an appropriate commit message.

4. **Push to the Master Branch:**

   Push the committed changes to the master branch:

   ```bash
   git push origin master
   ```

   This command pushes the changes to the remote repository (in this case, the "origin" remote) on the master branch.

Now the `index.html` file should be added, committed, and pushed to the master branch of the `/usr/src/kodekloudrepos/beta` repository on the storage server. Make sure to replace placeholders like `storage-server` and commit messages with actual values according to your environment.
