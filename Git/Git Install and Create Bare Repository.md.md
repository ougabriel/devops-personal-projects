The Nautilus development team shared requirements with the DevOps team regarding new application development.â€”specifically, they want to set up a Git repository for that project. Create a Git repository on Storage server in Stratos DC as per details given below:



Install git package using yum on Storage server.


After that create a bare repository /opt/beta.git (make sure to use exact name).



----------------


To create a Git repository on the Storage server in the Stratos Datacenter, follow these steps:

1. **Connect to Storage Server:**

   Log in to the Storage server using SSH or your preferred remote access method.

2. **Install Git:**

   Use the `yum` package manager to install the Git package:

   ```bash
   sudo yum install git -y
   ```

   This command will install Git on the Storage server.

3. **Create Bare Repository:**

   Now, create a bare Git repository named `/opt/beta.git`. A bare repository does not have a working directory, and it's typically used as a central repository for collaboration.

   ```bash
   sudo git init --bare /opt/beta.git
   ```

   This command initializes a new bare Git repository in the specified location.

4. **Set Permissions (Optional):**

   Depending on your security and access requirements, you might need to adjust the permissions for the repository directory. You can ensure that the appropriate users have read and write permissions.

   For example, you can set the permissions to allow the `git` user (or the user you plan to use for managing Git) to access the repository:

   ```bash
   sudo chown -R git:git /opt/beta.git
   ```

   Replace `git:git` with the appropriate user and group if necessary.

5. **Confirm Repository Creation:**

   You can confirm that the repository has been created by listing the repository directory's contents:

   ```bash
   ls -l /opt/beta.git
   ```

   You should see Git-related files and directories inside the repository directory.

The Git repository `/opt/beta.git` has been successfully created on the Storage server in the Stratos Datacenter. This repository can now be used by the Nautilus development team for version control and collaboration on the new application development project.
