One of the Nautilus developer was working to test new changes on a container. He wants to keep a backup of his changes to the container. A new request has been raised for the DevOps team to create a new image from this container. Below are more details about it:


a. Create an image blog:xfusion on Application Server 3 from a container ubuntu_latest that is running on same server.



------------------


To create a new Docker image from a running container named `ubuntu_latest` and tag it as `blog:xfusion`, you can follow these steps:

1. **Commit Changes to Container:**

   Before creating the new image, you need to commit the changes made in the `ubuntu_latest` container to a new image. You can use the `docker commit` command:

   ```bash
   docker commit ubuntu_latest blog:xfusion
   ```

   This command takes the `ubuntu_latest` container and creates a new image tagged as `blog:xfusion`.

2. **Verify New Image:**

   After committing the changes and creating the new image, you can verify that the image has been created:

   ```bash
   docker images
   ```

   This command will list all Docker images on your system, and you should see the newly created `blog:xfusion` image in the list.

The `docker commit` command allows you to create an image from the current state of a container. However, it's important to note that this approach is generally used for creating ad-hoc images during development and testing. For production use cases, it's recommended to use Dockerfiles and version-controlled images.

Additionally, keep in mind that creating images using the `docker commit` command may not capture all changes or configurations accurately, especially if you've made extensive modifications to the container. In such cases, it's better to use Dockerfiles for building images to ensure reproducibility and proper documentation of changes.
