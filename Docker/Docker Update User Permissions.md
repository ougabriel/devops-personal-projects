One of the Nautilus project developers need access to run docker commands on App Server 1. This user is already created on the server. Accomplish this task as per details given below:



User ravi is not able to run docker commands on App Server 1 in Stratos DC, make the required changes so that this user can run docker commands without sudo.


---------------


To allow the user `ravi` to run Docker commands on App Server 1 without using `sudo`, you need to add the user to the `docker` group. Members of the `docker` group have the necessary permissions to interact with the Docker daemon.

Here's how you can achieve this:

1. **Add User to the `docker` Group:**

   Add the user `ravi` to the `docker` group using the `usermod` command:

   ```bash
   sudo usermod -aG docker ravi
   ```

   The `-aG` options indicate adding the user to the group without removing them from other groups, and the `docker` group is specified.

2. **Log Out and Log In:**

   For the changes to take effect, the user `ravi` needs to log out and log back in. Alternatively, they can use the following command to refresh their group memberships without logging out:

   ```bash
   newgrp docker
   ```

3. **Verify Docker Access:**

   After logging in again or using `newgrp`, the user `ravi` should be able to run Docker commands without using `sudo`:

   ```bash
   docker version
   ```

   If the command executes successfully without requesting a password, then the user has the necessary Docker permissions.

Please note that granting users access to Docker should be done with caution, as it allows them to interact with potentially sensitive and powerful resources. Always ensure that only trusted users have Docker access, and consider the security implications of adding users to the `docker` group.

You can verify whether the configuration to allow the user `ravi` to run Docker commands without `sudo` has been successful using the following steps:

1. **Check User's Group Membership:**

   Run the `groups` command for the user `ravi` to see their group memberships:

   ```bash
   groups ravi
   ```

   Make sure that the output includes the `docker` group. It should look something like:

   ```
   ravi : <other groups> docker
   ```

2. **Test Docker Command:**

   Log in as the user `ravi` or use `su` to switch to the `ravi` user:

   ```bash
   su - ravi
   ```

   Then, try running a simple Docker command without using `sudo`, such as:

   ```bash
   docker version
   ```

   If the command runs successfully without asking for a password, it means the user `ravi` has been successfully granted Docker access.

3. **Check Docker Commands:**

   As the `ravi` user, try running various Docker commands, such as creating and running a Docker container:

   ```bash
   docker run -it --rm alpine
   ```

   If the user can successfully run Docker commands without using `sudo`, it indicates that the configuration has been set up correctly.
