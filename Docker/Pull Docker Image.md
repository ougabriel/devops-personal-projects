Nautilus project developers are planning to start testing on a new project. As per their meeting with the DevOps team, they want to test containerized environment application features. As per details shared with DevOps team, we need to accomplish the following task:


a. Pull busybox:musl image on App Server 3 in Stratos DC and re-tag (create new tag) this image as busybox:media.


-----------

To accomplish the task of pulling the `busybox:musl` image and re-tagging it as `busybox:media` on App Server 3 in the Stratos Datacenter, follow these steps:

1. **SSH into App Server 3:**

   Open a terminal or command prompt and SSH into App Server 3:

   ```bash
   ssh your_username@app-server-3
   ```

   Replace `your_username` with your actual username and `app-server-3` with the hostname or IP address of the server.

2. **Pull and Re-Tag the Image:**

   Run the following commands to pull the `busybox:musl` image and then re-tag it as `busybox:media`:

   ```bash
   docker pull busybox:musl
   docker tag busybox:musl busybox:media
   ```

   The first command pulls the `busybox:musl` image from the Docker Hub. The second command re-tags the image to `busybox:media`.

3. **Verify the Re-Tagged Image:**

   You can verify that the re-tagging was successful by running:

   ```bash
   docker images busybox
   ```

   This will list the available tags for the `busybox` image. You should see both the `musl` and `media` tags associated with the `busybox` image.

That's it! You've successfully pulled the `busybox:musl` image and re-tagged it as `busybox:media` on App Server 3 in the Stratos Datacenter.
