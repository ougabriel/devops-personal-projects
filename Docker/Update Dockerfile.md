As per recent requirements shared by the Nautilus application development team, they need custom images created for one of their projects. Several of the initial testing requirements are already been shared with DevOps team. Therefore, create a docker file /opt/docker/Dockerfile (please keep D capital of Dockerfile) on App server 3 in Stratos DC and configure to build an image with the following requirements:



a. Use ubuntu as the base image.


b. Install apache2 and configure it to work on 5000 port. (do not update any other Apache configuration settings like document root etc).



-----------------

Certainly, I'll help you create the Dockerfile based on the requirements and also provide steps to confirm if Apache2 is running within the container. Here's how you can achieve this:

1. **Create Dockerfile**:
   SSH into App Server 1 and create the Dockerfile at the specified path `/opt/docker/Dockerfile`:

   ```Dockerfile
   # Use ubuntu as the base image
   FROM ubuntu

   # Install apache2 and configure it to work on port 5000
   RUN apt-get update && \
       apt-get install -y apache2 && \
       echo "Listen 5000" > /etc/apache2/ports.conf

   # Expose the port
   EXPOSE 5000

   # Command to start apache2 in the foreground
   CMD ["apache2ctl", "-D", "FOREGROUND"]
   or 
   CMD ["apache2ctl", "-DFOREGROUND"]
   ```

2. **Build the Docker Image**:
   Run the following command on App Server 1 to build the Docker image:

   ```bash
   docker build -t custom-apache-image -f /opt/docker/Dockerfile /opt/docker
   ```

3. **Confirm if Apache2 is Running**:
   After building the image, you can run a container based on the image to verify if Apache2 is running as expected:

   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name apache-container custom-apache-image
   ```

   This command starts a Docker container named `apache-container` based on the `custom-apache-image` image, mapping port 5000 from the container to port 5000 on the host.

4. **Check Apache2 Status**:
   To confirm if Apache2 is running within the container, you can use the following steps:

   a. Enter the running container's shell:

   ```bash
   docker exec -it apache-container /bin/bash
   ```

   b. Check the status of the Apache2 service:

   ```bash
   service apache2 status
   ```

   c. You should see the status of the Apache2 service indicating whether it's running or not.

5. **Access Apache2 from Host**:
   Once the container is running, you can access Apache2 by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://<server_ip>:5000` (replace `<server_ip>` with the actual IP address of your server).

   or 

 ```bash
   docker exec -it apache-container /bin/bash
   curl http://localhost:5000
   ```
